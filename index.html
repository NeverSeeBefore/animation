        <h3>
            useTransition
        </h3>
        <p>
            <span class="underline">useTransition</span> is a React Hook that lets you update the state without blocking
            the UI.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="underline">
                useTransition is a Hook, so it can only be called inside components or custom Hooks. If you need to
                start a Transition somewhere else (for example, from a data library), call the standalone
                startTransition instead.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="underline">
            <span>
                You can wrap an update into a Transition only if you have access to the set function of that state. If
                you want to start a Transition in response to some prop or a custom Hook value, try useDeferredValue
                instead.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="underline">
            <span>
                The function you pass to startTransition must be synchronous. React immediately executes this function,
                marking all state updates that happen while it executes as Transitions. If you try to perform more state
                updates later (for example, in a timeout), they won’t be marked as Transitions.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="underline">
            <span>
                A state update marked as a Transition will be interrupted by other state updates. For example, if you
                update a chart component inside a Transition, but then start typing into an input while the chart is in
                the middle of a re-render, React will restart the rendering work on the chart component after handling
                the input update.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="underline">
            <span>
                Transition updates can’t be used to control text inputs.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="underline">
            <span>If there are multiple ongoing Transitions, React currently batches them together. This is a limitation
                that will likely be removed in a future release.</span>
        </p>
